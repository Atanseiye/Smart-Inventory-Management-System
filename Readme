    - Sales trends.
    - Predicted demand.

    - Prediction Agent: Uses machine learning to forecast future demand.
    - Decision-Making Agent: Decides when and how much to restock based on:
        Stock levels.
        Forecasted demand.
        Available budget.
    - Action Agent: Executes the decision (e.g., sends a restocking request or alerts).
